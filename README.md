Ceph-open-terrarium lets deploy a ceph cluster on libvirt-kvm via terraform with saltstack or ansible or any other config mgmt tool.

# Install:

You need to install terraform  https://www.terraform.io/ and https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt.

For the config management you will need to have saltstack or ansible installed on the machine executing the states/playbook.

# Examples:

Have a look at `examples` dir for how to use `ceph-open-terrarium`.

# Design-Architecture:

The architecture of project doesn't mix deployment with config management.
So you will be able to do `terraform apply` for preparing your KVM instances and use the config management of your choice for setup `ceph`

For explanation, remarks about the current Architecture design, have a look here [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Deploy:

Take an example.tf file and run `terraform apply`

Deployment will focus on libvirt-kvm.
ceph-open-terrarium will use https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt  for deploying via terraform and cloudinit.

( Due to the modular nature of terraform, we might add terraform for cloud or other providers but for the first releases is out of scope.)

## Config Management:

### The saltstack way:

Follow instruction here:
https://github.com/MalloZup/ceph-open-terrarium/tree/master/salt
This will then setup the requirements for deepSea.

https://github.com/SUSE/DeepSea

### The ansible way:

Once you have the IPs adress of the virtual hosts, you can use ansible.
For ansible, have a look at upstream doc https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible

# Roadmap:

Have a look on the roadmap board under github Projects.

# Supported/Avaible Operating Systems

You can use following OS-images.
Note: We are providing the OS-images, feel free to fix/expand the terraform files and relative modules.

**Requirements:** For adding an OS on the table we need a cloud-image avaible upstream.

There are Linux Entreprise System however this images are not open to community.
