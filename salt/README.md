# Saltstack provisioning ceph

This dir will contain mainly salt-ssh roster and salt-states for setting up the salt cluster needed by Deepsea.


# install and running:

`zypper -n in salt-ssh python2-salt`


# Install ceph prerequisites:


```shell
create_roster_and_pillar.py
salt-ssh '*' state.highstate -i
```

You need to accept the key with

```bash
salt-ssh 'salt-master' cmd.run 'salt-key -A -y' -i
```

After this you should be able to run deepsea.


#### Note/Assumptions: 

The script: `create_roster_and_pillar.py` is  expecting to have ips in hosts.txt file

You need this on your `main.tf` file ( this is present for example in `sles12sp3.tf`
```
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.network_interface.0.addresses.0} >> hosts.txt"
}
```



# Deepsea:

### Useful commands
Here some example basic what you can do with deepsea:

get the adress ip of salt-master with:
```bash
 salt-ssh -H
```

Then login on the `salt-master` and run

```bash
salt-run state.orch ceph.stage.0
```
